<p>This repository will guide you to grasp the basic syntax of any language,So that you can pick anyone to work with it in near future.</p>


## Overview:-
<p>This is my hands-on practices with various languages which i have learnt till now!!.I have been coding from last two years and at the beginning I found it really to code in any lanaguage,I took many video tutorials to become more fluent in writting codes though i found it really helpful but at the same time these process are really boring and lengthy,because watching videos may make you feel sleepy and that's not we want.So what I came up with is why not we put our hands in it and make it dirty.So I picked some languages like java,python,c++,Which I have learnt in my computer science course or from some other video tutroials.I have tried to implement the basics of the language so that anyone can get the pattern of any lanaguage.Suppose you have a background of c++ and wanted to learn python so watch out my codes and implement it in your own machine so that you can find the differences between loops,conditional etc.</p>


<p>Learning any language is not a big deal,because if you have some prior expirence of coding it might take you 2-3 days to settle up with the synatx of any language,because every lanaguage has conditionals,looping,functions,etc. Or If you are starting programming for the first time it will take you couple of weeks or may be less time if you practice honestly.the only prerequiste for that you have to know some basic maths and some basic computer commands.</p>
